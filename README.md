# 64BitALU-VHDL
64Bit Arithmetic Logic Unit - Computer Hardware/CPU
Developed a 64-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using VHDL and AMD Vivado, integrating Arithmetic, Logic, and
Shifter Units. The ALU supported 12 operations through a 4-bit operation code for arithmetic, logical, and shift/rotate
functions. Created a comprehensive testbench to verify functionality and validated correctness with waveform
simulations. Gained hands-on experience with digital systems, embedded logic, and structural hardware design. This
project enhanced skills in digital architecture, structural VHDL coding, and hardware validation, highlighting the ALU's
crucial role in CPU performance.
